## Cypress IntelliSense

If you use modern IDE that supports TypeScript (like VSCode), you can benefit
from Cypress type declarations included with the `cypress` NPM module. Just
add `@ts-check` to the spec file and configure "dummy"
[tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) file and see IntelliSense over `cy.<something>`
commands.
